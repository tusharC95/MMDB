MMDB - API Key Setup for Testing
=================================

CURRENT STATE:
--------------
- Config.plist currently has placeholder "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
- App will show configuration alert when launched

TO TEST THE APP:
----------------
1. Get free API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

2. Open MMDB/Config.plist and replace:
   <string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
   
   with:
   <string>your_actual_api_key</string>

3. Build and run - app will work normally

SECURITY VERIFICATION:
----------------------
✓ Config.plist.template has placeholder only (safe to commit)
✓ AppCoordinator shows alert if config missing

FILES STRUCTURE:
----------------
✓ MMDB/Config.plist          - Your API key (NOT in git)
✓ MMDB/Config.plist.template - Placeholder (IN git)
✓ MMDB/Configuration.swift   - Secure loader (IN git)
✓ .gitignore                 - Excludes Config.plist

This follows industry best practices for API key management in iOS apps.
